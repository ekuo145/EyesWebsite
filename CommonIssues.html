                    <h2>What is Myopia?</h2>
                <p>Myopia is the medical term for nearsightedness.</p>
                <p>It is usually developed during childhood and adolescence (MayoClinic).</p>
                <p> Compared to normal vision, which uses the <span class="term">lens <span class="termDefinition">Tooltip text</span></span> and <span class="term">cornea <span class="termDefinition">Tooltip text</span></span> to focus light on the <span class="term">retina <span class="termDefinition">Tooltip text</span></span>, the eye of someone with myopia is much longer and oval shaped (see figure 1 above), resulting in light being focused in front of the retina instead (MayoClinic).</p>
                <p>Some common risk factors include: genetics, doing a lot of up close activities like reading, screen time, and not going outside enough (MayoClinic)</p>

                    <h2>Hyperopia and Presbyopia</h2>
                    <p>Hyperopia is the medical term for farsightedness.</p>
                    <p>Presbyopia is the medical term for age-related farsightedness</p>
                    <p>People with farsightedness can see things clearly further away, but close up activities like reading get blurry</p>
                    <p>Hyperopia happens because the eye is too short or too flat (see figure 1 above), causing light to be underfocused and be focused past the retina, making it blurry (ClevelandClinic)</p>
                    <p>The main cause for this is genetic, and it develops when one is very little</p>
                    <p>Presbyopia is developed after 40 and continues to get worse until 65 (MayoClinic)</p>
                    <p>The lens gets less flexible as one gets older, so it struggles with adjusting to focus light correctly, sending the light past the retina (MayoClinic)</p>

            <h2>Colorblindness</h2>
            <p>Colorblindness is a condition that makes people have difficulties distinguishing between certain colors. It is often caused by a genetic defect that affects the cones.</p>
            <p>Colorblindness usually runs in families and is passed down genetically (National Eye Institute).</p>
            <p>The different types of colors can vary, with the most common being red-green and the less common complete colorblindness, when people don't see any color (see figure 2 below). </p>
            <p>People at higher risk for color blindness are: Men, people with family history, people with certain eye diseases, people with diabetes/alzheimers/multiple scelosis, or are white (National Eye Institute)</p>

    <h2>What is Glaucoma</h2>
    <p> Glaucoma is a condition that causes blindness as a result of damage to the optic nerve (National Eye Institute).</p>
    <p>It starts off with losing peripheral vision, and when not treated, can lead to blindness</p>
    <p>Glaucoma can be caused a blockage of ducts that drain the aqueous humor (see figure 3 below), the build up of which will increase the pressure in the eye (Campbell Biology).</p>
    <p>People at higher risk for glaucoma are: African American people older than 40, people older than 60, especially those who are Hispanic/Latino, and people with family history (National Eye Institute)</p>
