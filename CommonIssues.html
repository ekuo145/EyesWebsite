                  <h2>Common Issues</h2>
                  <p>Not everyone's eyes are able to see as well as the normal person.</p>
                  <p>Common issues with the eyes are myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness) and colorblindness.</p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Myopia</h2>
                <p>Myopia is the medical term for nearsightedness.</p>
                <p>It is usually developed during childhood and adolescence (MayoClinic).</p>
                <p>Compared to noraml vision, which uses the lens and cornea to focus light on the retina, the eye of someone with myopia is much longer and oval shaped, resulting in light being focused in front of the retina instead (MayoClinic).</p>
                <div class="term">Hover over me
                    <span class="termDefinition">Tooltip text</span>
                  </div>
                <p>Some common risk factors include: genetics, doing a lot of up close activities like reading, screen time, and not going outside enough (MayoClinic)</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Hyperopia and Presbyopia</h2>
                <p>Hyperopia is the medical term for farsightedness.</p>
                <p>Presbyopia is the medical term for age-related farsightedness</p>
                <p>People with farsightedness can see things clearly further away, but close up activities like reading get blurry</p>
                <p>Hyperopia happens because the eye is too short or too flat, causing light to be underfocused and be focused past the retina, making it blurry (ClevelandClinic)</p>
                <p>The main cause for this is genetic, and it develops when one is very little</p>
                <p>Presbyopia is developed after 40 and continues to get worse until 65 (MayoClinic)</p>
                <p>The lens gets less flexible as one gets older, so it struggles with adjusting to focus light correctly, sending the light past the retina (MayoClinic)</p>

            <h2>Colorblindness</h2>
            <p>Colorblindess usually runs in families and is passed down genetically (National Eye Institute).</p>
            <p>The different types of colors can vary, with the most common being red-green and the less common complete colorblindness, when people don't see any color. </p>
            <p>People at higher risk for color blindness are: Men, people with family history, people with certain eye diseases, people with diabetes/alzheimers/multiple scelosis, or are white (National Eye Institute)</p>
