                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>When we see, what we actually see are electromagnetic rays at the wavelength of visible light.</p>
                    <p>We see different color light rays, where when something appears a certain color, it means the object has abosrbed everything except that color.</p>
                    <p>The eye starts by taking in light using its photoreceptors, and turning it into nerve signals that the brain can understand</p>
                    <p>The photoreceptors create action potentials that go to the visual cortex. </p>
                    <p>See the eye anatomy page for more details on this topic</p>

                    <h2>Wavelengths of Light</h2>
                    <p>Light is a form of electromagnetic waves, falling in the middle of the spectrum. </p>
                    <p>Visible light falls from 400nm to 700nm, with the lower numbers representing bluer colors and the bigger numbers representing more red colors (Crash Course).</p>

                    <h2>How Do These Waves of Light Turn into What We See?</h2>
                    <p>A sensory pathway begins with sensory reception, the detection of a stimulus by sensory cells. It is then converted into a change in membrane potential (called sensory transduction). The action potentials (sensory information) are transmitted to the Central Nervous System by transmission (Campbell Biology)</p>
                    <p>Neurons that act directly as sensory receptors transmit signals through an axon, other sensory receptors regulate the neuron, where it releases neurotransmitters to receptor proteins on the neuron in response to stimulus. (Campbell Biology)</p>
                    <p>Stronger stimulus will trigger more action potentials to be released by receptors, and may also increase the number of receptors that are activated. This increase in action potentials being sent is decoded to be stronger stimulus by the nervous system. (Campbell Biology)</p>
                    <p>When action potentials come into the brain, circuits of neurons process the input which creates the perception of the stimuli, such as colors, smells, sounds, and tastes. Fun Fact: Colors, smells, sounds, and taste do not exist outside of the brain, it is all in response to action potentials from the sensory receptors (Campbell Biology).</p>
