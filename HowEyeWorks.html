                    <h2>What is Light?</h2>
                    <p>When we see, what we actually see are electromagnetic rays at the wavelength of <b>visible light</b> (see figure 1 below for visualization).</p>
                    <p>Visible light falls from 400nm to 700nm, with the lower numbers representing bluer colors and the bigger numbers representing more red colors (Crash Course, 2015).</p>
                    <p>Fun fact: Even though we can see millions of shades of color, some colors like magenta don't actually exist, and our mind makes it up when our <span class="term">cones <span class="termDefinition">Photoreceptors that specialize in seeing color</span></span> pick up pure red and pure blue</p>

                    <h2>How the Sensory Pathway Start?</h2>
                    <p>First, the photoreceptors detect light in a process called <b>sensory reception</b> (Campbell et al., 2020). Following this, they generate <b>receptor potentials</b> in a process called <b>sensory transduction</b> (Campbell et al., 2020).</p>
                    <p>The receptor potentials are like mini signals saying, there is something here, and if there is a big enough receptor potential, an <b>action potential</b> is released. Stronger stimulus leads to a bigger receptor potential which leads to more action potentials being produced(see figure 2 for a visualization) (Campbell et al., 2020). The action potentials then follow the axons of the <span class="term">ganglion neurons <span class="termDefinition">Neurons that take in info from photoreceptors and creates action potentials, its axons form the optic nerve.</span></span> to the brain. </p>
                    <p>But how does the action potential stay around that long?</p>
                    <p>Enzyme-catalyzed reactions boost the energy of the stimulus so that it can be detected and processed by the nervous system better in a process known as <b>amplification</b> (Campbell et al., 2020). However, photoreceptors are numbed in a process called <b>sensory adaptation</b> in response to a constant stimulus to ensure the brain isn't overloaded (Campbell et al., 2020). </p>

                    <h2>How Does it Reach the Visual Cortex?</h2>
                    <p>The <span class="term">optic nerves <span class="termDefinition">A bunch of axons from ganglion cells weaved together, it is the pathway for action potentials to travel on to get to the visual cortex</span></span> of both eyes meet at the optic chiasm, the space right before the cerebral cortex, and swap sides so the left side's stimulation goes to the right side of the brain (see figure 3 for a visualization) (Campbell et al., 2020).</p>
                    <p>The action potentials are carried to the visual cortex by <b>synapsing</b> with interneurons in the brain, jumping between the neurons. (Campbell et al., 2020). </p>

                <h2>What Happens in the Visual Cortex?</h2>
                <p>The visual cortex is located at the back of the brain, and it processes information from the <span class="term">retinas <span class="termDefinition">A structure that covers the entire back wall of the eye, it is filled with photoreceptors</span></span> and assembles images in our heads.</p>
                <p>When action potentials come into the brain, circuits of neurons process the input to create a <b>perception of the stimuli</b>, forming as colors, smells, sounds, and tastes. (Campbell et al., 2020).</p>
                <p>Fun Fact: Colors, smells, sounds, and taste don't exist outside of the brain, it is all created in response to action potentials from the sensory receptors.</p>
