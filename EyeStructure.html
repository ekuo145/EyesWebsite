                  <p>Key components include the cornea, iris, lens, and the retina (made up of rods and cones).</p>

                <h2>Front of the Eye</h2>
                <p>When you look at an eye, you will probably first see the <b>sclera</b>, the white part of the eye. This part serves to protect the eye and is an attachment point for muscles (Khan Academy, n.d.). </p>
                <p>Looking more towards the center of the eye, without realizing it, you will be looking through the <b>cornea</b>, a transparent dome-shaped layer in front of the eye, which is responsible for keeping dirt away and helping to focus light onto the retina (Khan Academy, n.d.).</p>
                <p>Just behind the cornea there is a watery layer called the <b>aqueous humor</b>, which is constantly refilling and draining and keeps the eye nourished (Campbell Biology, 2020)</p>
                <p>There you will see the <b>iris</b>, the colored part of your eye which regulates the size of the <b>pupil</b> to not let too much or too little light in (Campbell Biology, 2020).</p>
                <p>The pupil is the black hole in the middle of the iris (see figure 1 below for visualization)</p>

          <div class="border">
              <h2>Lens and Retina</h2>
              <p>After light passes through the pupil, it hits the <b>lens</b>, which changes shape to help focus light onto the <b>retina</b>(Campbell Biology)</p>
              <p>Before the light hits the retina, it needs to pass through a transparent jellylike layer called the <b>vitreous humor</b>, which provides structure for the eye and helps suspend the lens in place (Khan Academy, n.d.) .</p>
              <p>The retina is a structure that covers the entire back wall of the eye (see figure 2 below for visualization) (Khan Academy). It is filled with photoreceptors, specifically, rods and cones in the outer layer, and it also contains neurons, specifically ganglion and bipolar neurons (Crash Course, 2015).</p>
              <p>Rods are the photoreceptors responsible for our night vision and peripheral vision, and they are highly sensitive to light but only sees in black and white (Campbell Biology, 2020). </p>
              <p>Cones are the photoreceptors that see in less detail, but are responsible for our color vision (Campbell Biology, 2020).</p>
              <p>Bipolar neurons communicate data from the photoreceptors to the ganglion neurons, which generates <span class="term">action potentials <a href="HowEyeWorks.html" class="termDefinition">Click Here to Learn More</a></span> (Crash Course, 2015).</p>
              <p>The axons (tail like structures attached to neurons that are like a road for action potentials) of the ganglion neurons come together to form the optic nerve, which goes all the way to the visual cortex (Crash Course, 2015).</p>

            <h2>Protective Measures</h2>
            <p>Outside of the eye, the body has many protective features such as eyebrows which keep sweat off away from the eyes, eyelashes which trigger blinking out of reflex to keep things like sand out of your eyes, and eyelids which protect the eyes from the sun and other particles (Crash Course, 2015).</p>
            <p>Tears also function to wash away the particles in the eyes and keep it moisturized, so the eye doesn't get dry and irritated (National Eye Institute, 2019)</p>
